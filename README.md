# Blockchain-Cryptography-Challege
A personal project to convert a 40 key blockchain address into a cryptographic image using Python and the Pygame library.
Originally prototyped this idea with my fellowship team at IDEO CoLab and decided to program it. I am planning on updating this as I learn more about cryptography and computer algorithms.
